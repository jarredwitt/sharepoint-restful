SharePoint-RESTful
==================

Provides an easy way to work with the SharePoint REST API from node. Only works with on-premise SharePoint environments with sites that are configured to allow basic authentication. 

Every operation returns a promise.

Examples are somewhat hard to show for this but I have provided an examples.js that shows how to upload a document. I will be providing some better examples here in the future once the code gets a little more ironed out so please check back or file an issue if you need some help.

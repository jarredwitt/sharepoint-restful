SharePoint-RESTful
==================

Provides an easy way to work with the SharePoint REST API from node. Only works with on-premise SharePoint environments with sites that are configured to allow basic authentication. 

Every operation returns a promise.

### Update

I am currently doing a lot of work on this project at the moment and will be pushing it to github within the next week. There will be a more robust example that has an actual GUI so that examples can be run a bit easier. Stay tuned.
